This application uses the Gaceta Municipal de Barcelona as the source of the data.

In this application, we use a very simple approach of comparing an algorithmic score of redundancy (e.g. similarity measures) with human evaluation.

The application provides three simple answers as action buttons:

  * Yes
  * No and
  * I don't know

Based on the answer of the users, we will be able to classify / qualify redundancy.
